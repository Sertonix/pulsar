# Clojure language support in Pulsar

Adds syntax highlighting to Clojure files in Pulsar.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate)
from the [Clojure TextMate bundle](https://github.com/mmcgrana/textmate-clojure).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
