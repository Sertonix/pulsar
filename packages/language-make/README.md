# Make language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate) from the [Make TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/make.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
