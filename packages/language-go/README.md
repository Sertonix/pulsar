# Go language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Go files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate) from the [Go TextMate bundle](https://github.com/rsms/Go.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
